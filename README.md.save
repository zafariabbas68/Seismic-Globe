# Seismic Globe

## Overview

**Seismic Globe** is a data visualization project that maps earthquake events from 2020 to 2024 on a rotating 3D globe. The project fetches earthquake data from the USGS API, processes it, and generates an interactive 3D globe to visualize the earthquakes' location, magnitude, and depth. The globe can be viewed in real-time, and a 30-second animation is generated to showcase global earthquake activity.

## Features

- **Global Earthquake Data**: Fetches earthquake data (magnitude 5.0 and above) from the USGS Earthquake API.
- **3D Globe Visualization**: Interactive globe that shows earthquake activity over time.
- **Magnitude-based Marker Sizing**: Earthquake markers' size is dynamically scaled based on their magnitude.
- **Depth-based Coloring**: The color of earthquake markers reflects the depth of each earthquake.
- **Rotating Globe Animation**: Generates a 30-second animation showcasing the global earthquake activity, with the globe rotating to provide a full view.
- **Data Export**: The fetched earthquake data is saved as a CSV file for further analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zafariabbas68/Seismic-Globe.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Seismic-Globe
   ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dependencies:
- `pandas`: For handling the earthquake data.
- `requests`: To fetch data from the USGS API.
- `plotly`: For creating the interactive 3D globe visualization.
- `imageio`: To create the animation from the globe frames.

## Usage

### Step 1: Fetch Earthquake Data

The script automatically fetches earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API for the years 2020-2024. The data is filtered to include only earthquakes with a magnitude of 5.0 or higher.

Run the script to fetch the data:
```bash
python fetch_earthquake_data.py
```

This will save the earthquake data in a CSV file (`earthquake_data_2020_2024.csv`).

### Step 2: Visualize Earthquake Data

To visualize the earthquake data on the 3D globe, run the visualization script:
```bash
python visualize_earthquakes.py
```

This will open an interactive Plotly plot in your browser, displaying the earthquakes on a rotating globe.

### Step 3: Generate an Animation

To create a 30-second animation of the rotating globe with the earthquake data, use the following command:
```bash
python generate_animation.py
```

This will generate frames for the animation and compile them into an MP4 file (`Earthquake_Globe_Animation.mp4`).

## Animation Preview
